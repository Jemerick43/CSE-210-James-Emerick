This program is set up where you are able to run and play it without need to input
or update any of the character or enemy statistics. However, functionality for editing/updating
said information is included in the main menu screen, meaning such is also possible. The
base files for reading/writing include Party.txt and enemies.txt . The only input for file
location prompts should be Party.txt. Enjoy the program!
